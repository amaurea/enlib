# Implementation of preconditioned conjugate gradients. More general than
# the scipy version, in that it does not assume that it knows how to perform
# the dot product. This makes it possible to use this for distributed x
# vectors. It is pretty much a straight port of the fortran cg solver in
# the quiet pipeline.

# According to
# http://etna.math.kent.edu/vol.13.2002/pp56-80.dir/pp56-80.pdf
# the error (As the A-norm of the difference between the current
# and true value) at step i can be approximated well as the sqrt of
# sum(j=0:d-1) alpha(i+j)*rz(i+j) for large enough d, where 4 is
# sufficient. This means that we can't estimtate the current error,
# but we can estimate the error 4 steps in the past, which is good
# enough.
